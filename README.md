# ü¶∑ DentalAI ‚Äî Intelligent Dental Health Scanner & Dashboard

For ML Pipeline view [Hack4Health-ml](https://github.com/KunalSuman/ML_backend_oral_health)

DentalAI is a modern, two-way dental care platform that combines a Django backend, RESTful APIs, and a state-of-the-art deep learning pipeline. The platform empowers both patients and dentists ‚Äî patients can scan their teeth, receive instant AI-driven analysis, and track their health; dental professionals can monitor user submissions, review AI-generated reports, and provide informed guidance, all through a secure, intuitive dashboard.

## Features

- AI-Based Dental Issue Detection: Upload an image, get a score and diagnosis within seconds.
- Dual Dashboard Interface: Separate flows for patients and dentists, including onboarding, test management, and report review.
- Custom Scoring & Priority Assignment: Automated health score and urgency (Low / High / Emergency).
- Condition-wise Probability & Highlights: See per-condition AI probabilities and actionable highlights for every scan.
- RESTful, JSON-first API: Easy integration for new frontends, automation, or research.
- Mobile-First Frontend: Clean UX, responsive layouts for both Android/iOS and desktop.
- Verified Results: Every test report includes verification status and clearly identified highlights.
- Fast Inference: Model delivers results in under 0.2s (served via a separate ML pipeline).
